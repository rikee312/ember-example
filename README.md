##Ember-example
This is a Example App to do an integration with an example API:
http://ec2-54-172-57-71.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5000/api/hotels/17219/rooms/2
The hotels/{hotel_id}/rooms/{room_id} is the schema. CORS is enabled on server.

##The Test
Fork this project, configure the adapter os application, setup the model and 
routes to do a GET on our API.

What we want to see done is a way to trigger the get by user for the provided endpoint. 
The user should have a way to specify both hotel_id and room_id.

Please take into account that this is just a single endpoint in a very big 
application with many other endpoints present and the api address, specifically
http://ec2-54-172-57-71.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5000 would be changed in the future.
Try to take this into account when implementing the test-task.

The room model primary key is rateToken inside the rates array. Please assume 
that for every room the related rateToken which is primary key is the first one 
in the array. Implement the adapter/serializer/model in such way that the primary 
key for room is set correctly on data fetch.

After that, commit in a public repository. Send the link to us.
Good lucky!
